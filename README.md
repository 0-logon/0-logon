### 👨‍💻 About Me

I build stuff for the web — mostly with **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript** on the frontend, and occasionally some **Go** on the backend when needed.

I like clean, feature-based architecture that makes scaling apps feel natural, not like a chore. Reusable code, clear structure, and a focus on developer experience — that’s my thing.

Currently enjoying the process of leveling up across the stack, learning by doing, and keeping things simple, fast, and maintainable.
